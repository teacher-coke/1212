<p style="color: rgb(116, 52, 169);">
<br>In the near future, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide. Cooper's family, which includes his children, Tom and Murph, and his father-in-law Donald, engage in farming, like most of humanity. One evening, during a dust storm, Cooper and Murph discover a gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom that left patterns of falling particles. The pattern resolves into GPS coordinates, which lead Cooper and Murph to the secret facility of NASA, believed to have shut down.</br>

<br>NASA's mission is to find a habitable planet beyond the solar system. A team is preparing to travel through a wormhole near Saturn leading to a galaxy with three potentially habitable planets, based on data from three probe missions, each orbiting the supermassive blackhole Gargantua. Dr. Brand, lead scientist, asks Cooper to pilot due to his experience. Cooper struggles with leaving his children behind, but promises Murph that he will return. Heartbroken, Murph refuses to say goodbye. The Endurance spacecraft takes off with three other NASA scientists − Romilly, Doyle, and Brand's daughter Amelia − as well as two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE.</br>

<br>The crew arrive at the first planet to find an ocean world with massive tidal waves. Doyle is swept away and killed. Cooper and Amelia wait for water to drain from the craft and return to the Endurance, where 23 years have passed for Romilly due to time dilation.</br>

<br>On Earth, an adult Murph helps Dr. Brand with an equation to solve the problem of mass exodus — transporting Earth's population off the planet. On his deathbed, Brand reveals that the crew's goal was to colonize another planet rather than return with data that would help the existing population. Murph, despite wondering if Cooper knowingly abandoned her, continues to work on the problem.</br>

<br>On the second planet, the crew awakens the probe mission's explorer, Dr. Mann, from cryostasis. Mann offers to show Cooper the hospitable part of the planet, but then confesses to having falsified data so that someone might rescue him from the deserted ice world, and they begin to fight. Cooper survives the fight, while Romilly is killed while accessing Mann's data. Mann takes the Endurance crew's lander and beats them to the Endurance. With TARS having removed his security clearance to dock, Mann fails to dock correctly and is killed in an explosion that damages a portion of Endurance. Cooper and Amelia, with limited fuel remaining, chart a gravity-assist path around Gargantua to propel the craft to the third planet. At the last moment, Cooper detaches himself so that Amelia may reach the final planet. He and TARS fall beyond the black hole's event horizon.</br>

<br>Cooper falls into a five-dimensional tesseract, with time as a physical dimension, that appears to be the back of Murph's bookshelf. He uses gravity to communicate with Murph and his past self, and realizes he sent the NASA coordinates and initiated this mission, and that a future generation created the tesseract to preserve humankind. He decides to feed Murph the blackhole gravity data to help her solve the equation, and encodes the data as Morse code into the ticking minute hand of his wristwatch, which he gave Murph. Murph comes across the watch while visiting the family home for the last time. The tesseract dissolves, ejecting Cooper and TARS through the wormhole and into Saturn's orbit again, where a present-day (22nd century CE) spacefaring O'Neill cylinder picks them up.</br>

</p>

<p style="color: rgb(153, 149,230);">
    Interstellar is an immensely personal and human story. It's a powerful tale of a father and his relationship with his family, particularly his daughter. It explores the sacrifice that he and his family have to make in order to save humanity and whether they felt it was actually worth it in the end.
